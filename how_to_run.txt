In order to reproduce the results that we delivered you need to:

1- Run each and every "work*.ipynb" notebook seperately (One after the other to not
get any errors), we trained every model in a different notebook because we used
different parameters for every fold.
( Note: that you should put the competition data in the "data" folder and run every 
notebook seperately, DO NOT run the notebooks together!)

2- Running work0, work1, work 2, work 3, work 4, work 5, and work 6 one after the other
will generate the models weights in the "models" folder and the csv predictions in
the "results" folder ( Note that if you do not have these folders in your current directory,
the models will train and apply inference without saving the results.
In addition, if you want to edit the name of the folders [results, models..] you need
to change the Config class for every "work*.ipynb" notebook you run.

3- Run the "blend.ipynb" notebook and you will generate a file called "final_submission.csv"
You can use that for your final submission
